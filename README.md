# YUGICardReader – *Not a Cheating Tool!*

**Note:** This project was discontinued in **May 2024** because I no longer play Yu-Gi-Oh. It was created purely for fun and to enhance my personal gameplay experience.

## 💡 What Is YUGICardReader?

YUGICardReader is a lightweight card recognition tool designed to **assist gameplay** by displaying **card information** when your mouse hovers over a card image. It is **not an automated bot** and does **not perform any in-game actions**.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Displays card details and potential counter-measures during gameplay.
- Allows manual customization of each card's information for use as reminders.
- Uses image hashing to identify cards from the screen.
- Requires training of the image reader to generate a card hash dataset.
- Optimized for speed — may have minor inaccuracies that you can correct manually.

## 🖼️ Image Source

Card images and data are sourced from the [YGOPRODeck API](https://ygoprodeck.com/).

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. When the mouse hovers over a card, the program captures the screen area.
2. It generates a hash of the image and compares it against a pre-trained hash dataset.
3. Matching card information is displayed on-screen.
4. Users can manually correct or enhance hash points for better accuracy.

## ❗ Disclaimer

- This tool is intended only for personal use.
- It does **not** automate gameplay or interact with the game client.
- It simply offers **on-screen information** for cards as a supportive overlay.
- Use responsibly and ethically.
